# Ant Integration

In addition to the command line interface described in the
[Getting Started](#/guide/command) guide, Sencha Command also provides direct interfaces
for use in Ant.

[Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) has long been a pillar of the Java development community,
but at its core, Ant is an XML-based, cross-platform scripting platform. I say "platform"
rather than "language" because Ant can easily incorporate libraries of code in JAR form,
or you can use one of the many supported scripting languages as part of your Ant script.

Ant can, of course, call other programs (like Sencha Command), passing arguments and
processing exit codes, but what Ant is particularly good at is manipulating files. Certainly
this is because Ant was designed for use with build scripts.

As touched on in the [Advanced Sencha Command](#/guide/command_advanced) guide, Sencha
Command is delivered as a JAR file and it exposes its core functionality as an Ant Library
(or `antlib`). The command line level of Sencha Command, as well as SDK-specific processing
are implemented on top of this layer. So anything you can do in one, you can do in the
other.

If you are using Ant, it is better to interface to Sencha Command at this level rather
than make repeated calls through the command line interface.

    <taskdef resource="com/sencha/ant/antlib.xml" 
             classpath="${sencha.command.dir}/sencha.jar"/>

## x-sencha-command

This command is equivalent to the command line interface. The arguments are placed in the
body text of this tag, one argument per line. Spaces are trimmed at both ends, so indent
level is not significant. A good use of indentation is to clarify the command structure:

    <x-sencha-command>
        compile
            --classpath=app,sdk/src
            page
                --in=app/index.html
                --out=build/index.html
    </x-sencha-command>

Because each line is an argument, spaces are not special and should not be escaped or
quoted.

Ant properties are expanded, so the following (fairly conventional style) also works:

    <x-sencha-command>
        compile
            --classpath=${app.dir},${sdk.dir}/src
            page
                --in=${app.dir}/index.html
                --out=${build.dir}/index.html
    </x-sencha-command>

Finally, comments are supported so you can document the command or disable parts temporarily
without deleting them. Also, blank lines are skipped:

    <x-sencha-command>
        compile
            # Include the app folder and the sdk/src folder
            --classpath=${app.dir},${sdk.dir}/src

            # Turn off debugging (comment next line to leave debug enabled):
            # --debug=false

            page
                # The application main page:
                --in=${app.dir}/index.html

                # The compiled page goes in build folder along with "all-classes.js":
                --out=${build.dir}/index.html
    </x-sencha-command>

## x-generate

This task generates output from templates in two basic modes: `file` and `dir`. That is,
the template generator can be given a single source file or a source folder.

### Template Engines

The name of the template file determines the template engine used. Currently there are two
supported template engines:

 * `.vm` = [Velocity](http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html)
 * `.tpl` = [XTemplate](http://docs.sencha.com/ext-js/4-1/#!/api/Ext.XTemplate)

For example, "foo.js.vm" would be used to generate "foo.js" using the Velocity engine,
while "foo.js.tpl" would use XTemplate.

### Sacred Files

When generating code, files fall into two basic categories: machine maintained and user
maintained. It is desirable, however, to provide a starter or skeleton file at initial
generation even for files that will be ultimately user maintained.

This is called a "sacred" file and is identified by the source file extension of
".default". That is, the source file is just a default and will not replace an existing
file.

For example, one might want to generate a starter "readme.txt" file but preserve whatever
the user might have changed during a later regeneration. To do so, the source file would
be named "readme.txt.default".

Of course, there are times when a sacred file is also a template. This is done by adding
both extensions. For example, "readme.txt.vm.default". This "readme.txt" file is a sacred
file that is initially generated using Velocity.

### Parameters

Template generation requires data, or parameters. The simplest form of parameter uses the
`param` attribute:

    <x-generate ...>
        <param name="bar" value="42" />
    </x-generate>

Parameters can also be loaded from a file, like so:

    <x-generate ...>
        <load file="data.properties"/>
    </x-generate>

The following file types are understood automatically:

 * `.cfg` or `.properties` = A standard Java Properties file.
 * `.json` = A JSON data file.

If the file does not have one of these extensions, but is a properties file or JSON, you
can specify the `type` attribute as "json" or "properties" like so:

    <x-generate ...>
        <load file="data.props" type="properties" />
        <load file="data" type="json" />
    </x-generate>

NOTE: Parameters are applied in the order specified. Duplicate names are replaced if they
are encountered.

### x-generate file tofile

The simplest form of `x-generate` is using the `file` attribute to transform a single
template file to a specified output file:

    <x-generate file="foo.js.vm" tofile="build/foo.js">
        <param name="bar" value="42" />
    </x-generate>

The source filename determines how the process will proceed (which template engine to use
and if it is sacred), but that is all.

### x-generate file todir

In many cases, you can leave off the target filename and just specify the folder.

    <x-generate file="foo.js.vm" todir="build">
        <param name="bar" value="42" />
    </x-generate>

This will generate "foo.js" (using Velocity) in the "build" folder.

Beyond avoiding redundancy, this form also allows the source filename to be a template.
For example:

    <x-generate file="${name}.js.vm" todir="build">
        <param name="name" value="foobar" />
        <param name="bar" value="42" />
    </x-generate>

The source file exists with the specified name (i.e., "${name}.js.vm"), but this name is
transformed using the Velocity engine and the provided parameters to determine the target
filename.

In the above case, "foobar.js" will be generated in the "build" directory.

### x-generate dir todir

The final form of `x-generate` operates on a source folder, and generates content in the
target folder.

For example:

    <x-generate dir="templates/foo" todir="build/foo">
        <param name="bar" value="42" />
        <load file="data.json"/>
    </x-generate>

In this form, the generator recursively reads files and sub-folders in "templates/foo" and
applies the appropriate template engine. It will also preserve sacred files. Further all
file and folder names are processed as Velocity templates.

## sencha ant - TODO

To help setting up properties that reference Sencha Command (e.g., "sencha.command.dir"),
Sencha Command provides an "ant" command that mimics the normal Ant command line.

    sencha ant -Dfoo=bar build

The following subset of the Ant command line is supported:

    -diagnostics           print information that might be helpful to
                           diagnose or report problems.
    -debug, -d             print debugging information
    -lib <path>            specifies a path to search for jars and classes
    -logfile <file>        use given file for log
      -l     <file>                ''
    -logger <classname>    the class which is to perform logging
    -listener <classname>  add an instance of class as a project listener

    -verbose, -v           sencha -debug ant
    -emacs, -e             sencha -plain ant

The following Ant switches are not supported:

    -find <file>           (s)earch for buildfile towards the root of
      -s  <file>           the filesystem and use it
